# I-V-FTJ-simulation
ZIP contains: "pub_FTJ_5nm_adaptF.nb" - program that makes a simulation of the I-V curves in ferroelectric tunnel junctions, and computes the TER ratio, with/without hysteresis. Calculation includes the wave-function matching between barrier segments (Appendix 2,3), Transfer matrix application to define the transmission amplitudes of electron probability.  language: Wolfram Mathematica 11.3 Program name: pub_FTJ_5nm_adaptF.nb    In addition you can find an example of Transfer Matrix application for simple rectangular barrier: file name: ExampleOfTransferMatrixApplication.nb  folder "data generated by prog" contains the output files of the pub_FTJ_5nm_adaptF.nb folder "initial experimental data from VLSI" contains the experimental data as possible input data for pub_FTJ_5nm_adaptF.nb
